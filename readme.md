## Hanged Man

*Word game*

Try to guess the word before the poor man gets hanged!

The word you guess is picked at the beginning of each round from a certain file. You can either use a default set of words (1 000 items) or choose from your own list.
If the latter is the case, put the whole address (including extension) of your text file (in quotation marks) while launching the game.
**There has to be only one word per line in your file and no empty lines.** Otherwise, the program is launched with a default set of words.

### Good luck!
